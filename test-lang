* lite uses 4 white-space indentation for scoping but can also be written without indentation.
* lite sees 2 white-spaces as end of line.
* object lifetime is always scope bound
* no aliasing
* parameters and assignments are always passed by value
* type data are stored as SOA
* lite is a small language that compiles to langs like wasm/js, C, Rust etc. It will ultimately serve as a kind of language interface.
* lite is completely stack based and all data is stored as SOA.
* variables can only be overwritten to the same type. Variables containing an array can 
can only be overwritten by an array of the same type and size.  
* all type functions can be applied to an array of that type by default.
* arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /. These can also be used for operations on the to primitive data structures 
string and array. 
* comparison operators are =, >, <, !=, !>, !<.

* primitive data types/structures: i32,64, fl32,64, string, array. What types are avalible will vary with the underlying implementation. if type annotation is left
out the compiler will automatically infer the type to either i32, f32 or string.
