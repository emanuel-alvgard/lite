#/
* lite uses 4 white-space indentation for scoping but can also be written without indentation.
* lite sees 2 white-spaces as end of line.
* object lifetime is always scope bound
* no aliasing
* parameters and assigments are always passed by value
* type data are stores as SOA
* lite is a small language that compiles to langs like wasm/js, C, Rust etc. It will ultimatly serve as a kindof lang interface.
* lite uses 2 memory areas. The first one is the static area where all types are stored as SOA. 
The second area is the dynamic area which serves as the function "stack".
